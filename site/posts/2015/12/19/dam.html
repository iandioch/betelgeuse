		<p>So I came back from Amsterdam last night at 11pm. Was worn out. Still did a commit in the wee hours this morning.<br/><br/>Amsterdam was fantastic, a great end to a great first semester. I spent way more money than I have, and saw some really cool things. The light festival was amazing, the cheese shops were super cool, and the smell of weed was inescapable. I would like to learn some Dutch if I ever go again, the best places we found were those places where people didn't speak English by default.<br/><br/>The hostel was quite nice, The White Tulip, right within spitting distance of the red light district. It had a nicer mattress than I have here in Hampstead. Although, every 15 minutes some madman would start playing Christmas songs badly on the Church bells across the road.<br/><br/>I fell in love with Drambuie in the tiniest and cutest pub I've ever been in, De Blauwe Druif. I bought some Drambuie and scotch in the duty free in preparation for some rusty nail Christmas fun. Thanks to ~tbolt for the tip.<br/><br/>Today I did the Problem Solving essays that I was putting off, and now my work is done for this semester. I have two exams in the new year, and that's me.<br/><br/>I'm learning Go! It's very cool. I'm trying to do one Project Euler problem every day in Go, and then put that on my Github. That'll bump up my git stats, teach me a bit more about git, and let me get to grips with Go. <br/><br/>I went to Jimmy Carr with Tate last week, and next week I'm going to a concert in Dublin with the cousins. Busy! Happy. I need to get home between now and then, think I'll head on Sunday. In the meantime, I'm going to try and set up my website, and blog, properly. I'm thinking Vagrant, nginx and a little script to pull blogposts from Github. Ruhoh is cool, but it's Ruby, and I can't stand the fact that Ruby spells its constructor functions, "initialize", with a Z. We'll see how my solution turns out. <br/><br/>It's 4:03 in the morning, so I'll head to bed.<br/><br/>Goede nacht,<br/><br/>Noah<br/></p>
