Last weekend I went to Galway with Redbrick, for the first intersocs hackathon. It was good fun! Galway was very nice. I heard from the waiter in "Rockin' Joes" that there are 3 series of both Black Sails and The 100, whereas I'd only seen the first series of each. Plenty to keep me busy there. 

However, the reason I was there was to do analytics on some Twitter data. I'd had a Digital Ocean droplet running for about 10 days in the leadup to my trip, continuously logging all the geo-tagged data sent in the vicinity of the island of Ireland into a MongoDB collection. In the end, I had around 500k tweets; with half from the Republic of Ireland and the other half from Northern Ireland and some bits of Wales and Scotland that got caught in the bounding box.
