I'm on a Polskibus right now from Berlin to Poznan.

I will be on a STEP internship in Google Zurich from the beginning of July. I cannot wait. Not only am I working with the big GOOG, but it's in a foreign country, with a different language, and stunning views. What more could a just-ex-freshman want?! Seeing as I don't start until July, and Zurich is a bit away, I opted to spend June taking the scenic route, travelling around some of the bits of Europe I haven't seen.

First off; Germany!

# Bremen

I started off with a flight from Dublin to Bremen, right up in the front row (which is, naturally, row number 2). A hop, skip and a jump later I was chilling in the Townside Hostel, in the middle of Bremen. It was a very nice hostel. It even came with a free nude roommate who wasn't expecting anyone to be in the room when he came out of the shower.

Bremen was lovely; it was warm, bright, and pretty. There were parks, rivers, beautiful buildings, and an inordinate amount of cyclists. I spent time reading my wee book as Gaeilge in the sun with a Beck's, and I ate Italian... I'm able to understand "ravioli" much better than "schweinefleische". I broke my diabetic rules and bought some Apfelstrudel with ice cream. It was worth it.

Ar aghaidh liom chuig Hamburg ansin. I was going to go straight to Berlin, but I saw that Hamburg was on the way. The bus from Bremen to Hamburg was 7 EUR with Berlinlinienbus; I couldn't resist.

# Hamburg

Hamburg didn't seem great when I arrived. It was hot (~26∞C), noisy, and square. I was to stay in the A&O Hostel Hamburg City, on Spaldingstraﬂe, for one night. I went hostel-shopping for Berlin when I arrived, found the city was booked out, so arranged to stay in Hamburg for a second night.

Spaldingstraﬂe is hostel centre. There are a couple of huge hostels on the street, and little else. I did find a nearby hypermarket though, to stock up on the essentials: a lock for my luggage, cheese, and cheese accessories.

I went out on the town with a girl from the hostel. I saw the red lights of St Pauli, and enjoyed the freedom of walking down the street with a beer. The next afternoon I saw the Miniatur Wunderland, a big model railway exhibition... The fact I really enjoyed it shows exactly how boring I am.

I liked Hamburg in the end, but departed after two nights on a Flixbus to Berlin.

# Berlin

Berlin was okay.

The Wall was worth seeing, the Brandenburg Gate wasn't. I didn't go to any of the plethora of museums, as they cost money, and I wasn't there for long enough really anyway. The parks were not as nice as Hamburg or Bremen, but I did finish my book in the sun. The Mall of Berlin would I'm sure appeal to many, but I only went for the foodcourt. 

I stayed my first night there in St. Christopher's Berlin, and it was super. The location was fantastic (a stone's throw from Alexanderplatz), the staff were cool, and there was a good vibe around the place. My second night was in the Heart of Gold hostel, a Douglas Adams-themed affair, to the point that my dorm had 42 beds in it. It was good too, but it should have been cheaper, considering that I had 41 roommates.

My bus to Poznan was from the ZOB (Zentreles Omnibus Bahn [[[]]]), a 2 hour walk away. I opted to risk the S-bahn for the first time, having walked everywhere thus far. I bought what I thought was the right ticket, and was escorted off the train and fined 60 euro by the inspector. Apparently I didn't stamp the ticket. In my defence, the ticket machine was auf Deutsch.

I got to the bus in the end.

# Where I am metaphorically after Germany

- My German has improved from being non-existant to understanding the drunk man at the takeaway listing off the capitals of the countries in the UK. He was very proud of himself. I'm not sure why he was listing the capitals of the countries in the UK.
- I'm going to spend much longer staring at the ticket machine next time before I dare approach the choo choo.
- It would have been good to pick up a German dictionary and book before I left, so I could make a better attempt at the language. At the very least, it would have been great to have some way of reading the menus.
- I went to a second hand shop and found a Klaus Tuber game in German. I was tempted, but remembered that not only is my German woeful, but it's very unlikely I'd find anyone else willing to make the effort with the language.
- The German public wifi is probably better than at home, but still pretty poor. While all of the buses advertise on-board wifi, I haven't had it work yet once. In that respect it's just like home.
- German beer is good, but there was much more Pilsner than I expected. I found this quite agreeable in the end. There is nothing better than a cold Pils on a warm day.
- I should have brought a lock with me; it's needed for the cabinets in almost all of the hostels. It only cost 5 EUR, so it's not the end of the world. I'll add it to my list of "should"s for next time.
- Cheese. Yes.
- I loved Bremen, enjoyed Hamburg, and went to Berlin. Berlin did have some very interesting buildings though. I would probably go back to any of them quite happily.


# Where I am physically after Germany (I think)

- Poznan - 1 night - easy to get to from Berlin
- Wroclaw - 2 nights - "the Venice of Poland"
- Prague - 2 nights - supposed to be fun or something, idek
- Brno - 2 nights - it's on the way, why not?
- Bratislava - 3 nights - I don't speak any Slovak so I will have 3 days of scratching my head
- Budapest - 2 nights - the cheapest capital in Europe, supposedly. I'm excited and scared to get there.
- Zagreb - 2 nights - it seems a shame to get so close but see none of Croatia
- Maribor - 1 night - I have to go through Slovenia to get to Austria. I feel obliged to stop there and enjoy it.
- Graz - 1 night - it's on the road, and it might be more laidback than Vienna
- Vienna - 3 nights - the Donauinselfest! A free concert in a country that does good drinks. It might even be warm too. 
- Salzburg - 1 night - I have a friend there, and it seems like a cool place.
- Innsbruck - 1 night - it's really hard to find a way to get a bus to Italy from anywhere else in Austria it seems
- Verona - 1 night - if it's where the bus goes, then it's where I must go.
- Venice - 2 nights - ayy! Ciao belle!
- Milan - 1 night - I'm going here because I was warned not to go here. Also, there is a vroom vroom from here to Zurich.
- Zurich - 90 nights - 90 nights, give or take a googol

That'll all be rearranged as I get a better idea of prices, and what I want to do in each place.



For now anyway, I've got a few Zlotys and don't speak a word of Polish... Should be fun!
