I wanted to set up a new website & blog for myself, and I wanted to learn a few things. So I [created a repo](https://github.com/iandioch/betelgeuse/commit/5ef2db497c99b874bbf85ee6875db88eceee8612), and started working.

I named the project [Betelgeuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse), because space-things make nice names for projects. 

I opted to run my website on a VPS, because it'd give me much more control over everything, would teach me a lot about setting up a webserver, and would let me host anything else I make in the future on it too. I went for [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) because the Github Student Pack gave me €50 worth of free credits (although *grumble* I heard it used to be €100 worth *grumble*).

It's a server running Ubuntu 14.04 in Amsterdam, at the lowest DigitalOcean tier. I already had the domain name http://doesnot.run, having fought with [Cian Ruane](https://twitter.com/cianlr) over it a few weeks before.

I love the domain name.

Redbrick are in the motions of creating a new website, and in discussions, someone mentioned making it a static site generator that pulled content from Github. I thought that was a great idea. So that's what I made. Maybe it'll come in handy in the creation of Redbrick's one too.

The end result is [here](http://github.com/iandioch/betelgeuse). It is a static blog generator written in Go. Files are written in Markdown, with a little piece of YAML at the top keeping the metadata. This format was inspired by [ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com), a Ruby static site generator I was considering using.

The pages are generated by parsing out the metadata, converting the Markdown to HTML, pushing the data through a piece of Javascript (using the cool Go lib [otto](https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto)) to put the page together, and the end result being saved to a ./site directory for Nginx to pick up. Add a bit of CSS, *et voilà*.

The Javascript step is the only potentially weird one in that setup, I think. Most static site generators use [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) or the like to put the page together, which is fine, but while it advertises itself as "logic-less templates", I wanted logic...

I'm going to keep developing the project. I want to add to the Javascript files to figure out similar posts to link to at the end of each article, based on what tags it has in common with all the other posts. I also still need to add monitoring and traffic tools, to count how many people land on each page. The CSS will need tidying up, and the homepage should have a little preamble about me, and some links to things like my Github. I'd like to add a little link to each post on Github at the end of the page, like is on some of the pages on [Static Void Games](http://staticvoidgames.com), but that's not a high priority.

I still need to set up a an email for myself at the domain though, and redirect doesnot.run to mycode.doesnot.run.

It'll all come, in time.
