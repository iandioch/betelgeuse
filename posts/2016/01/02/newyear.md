I'm just back to Monaghan from a few days in Cork seeing dad & Theo, seeing cousins again now before they leave in the morning. 

It was a good holiday for games.

Mum got me a version of **Yahtzee** from Tiger, with different fruits on the dice rather than pips. Orange and apple look a bit similar, will have to try it out at some stage. The cousins brought a boardgame called **Tension**, involving trying to guess list items when given the title; eg. The list of "Disney villains" includes Cruella de Vil, Scar, etc. It suited us quite well, although it was clear from the cricket bats, wallpaper paste and the like mentioned in the lists, that it was geared towards a very English audience. It was good though, kind of like a Family Fortunes, but actually with your own family.

**Scattergories** was played too, and it's always great. We could do with a few more lists. It did most definitely not suit Lorcan, which I mostly expected. It's not for everyone. I really like it though. Unfortunately, it looks like myself and dad do some similar thinking, or perhaps just listen to the same music; many of our answers clashed. 

Speaking of dad, he bought me **Perudo** (aka. "**Liar's Dice**") for Christmas. I don't know if I've been giving off gamble-y vibes lately, with all the dice games, but I'm not complaining. We played it twice or three times in Cork, and I love it. Quite thinky, it also wouldn't be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. I could see it becoming extremely fun when you're drunk enough to have trouble counting. Also, it comes with its own cups <3

It turns out dad is quite the Yahtzee fan too, and had a set of his own which we played. I like it. I would take either Yahtzee or Perudo over poker any day of the week. I think I like Perudo more, but they're both very fun. Pass the Pigs and Zombie Dice have nothing on the push-your-luck thinking in Yahtzee; it and Perudo have introduced me to a whole new world of dice games. I'd heard of both before, but never played them. Turns out all you need are piles of dice, which I have! I look forward to playing it with some ones when I get back to DCU.

We played **Love Letter** with 4 in Cork, that's always great. I lost, and the first-timer Lorcan won, which shows how easy it is to pick up. It's really a stellar game.

I read most of the rules to dad's new copy of **Axis & Allies**... It's a very American game, lots of little thematic rules and the like. Don't know if it's my cup of tea, but I'm interested in giving it a go someday. I'd have Eclipse or something higher on my list of priories though.

We played **Saboteur** and **The Resistance** back in Monaghan. I now know for sure not to introduce those to the wrong crowd; they can get very confrontational. Unfortunately, I'll have to put a person or two on my "don't play this with them under any circumstances" list. We also played **Square**, which is a standard-deck card game involving trying to get a set of 4 of the same card and then secretly signalling your partner to announce it. It deserves a few more plays, I think it could be quite fun with the right people.

I was told about a new drinking game, **Paranoia**, by the twins. It seems interesting, I'm always on the lookout for a good drinking game. I can only take so much Kings. Paranoia involves one player asking a question in secret to another player, along the lines of "Who here is the most likely to do X?", or "Who here is the biggest Y?". The other person responds with their opinion to the entire group. If the person they decide is the answer wants to hear the question, they have to drink. It might be a good game among people who know each other quite well, we'll see.

This is a long post, mostly here for me to look back and remember later on, but thanks for reading anyway. Happy new year! I might think of a resolution in the next day or two; exercise more maybe.
