Christmas is going okay. I've had that same "meh" feeling about coming home from the city as I was expecting, but I've gotten into [Project Euler](http://github.com/iandioch/solutions), and writing the static site generator for this blog, enough to keep me busy and my mind occupied. 

Going to Dublin tomorrow to the 2FM charity concert with my cousins, looking forward to Little Green Cars & Ryan Sheridan. Should be good!

Meanwhile, I'm liking Go more and more, and will need to do some Python soon to keep that fresh too. Although I still feel the need for some functional, and Haskell is looking mighty tempting. *You can never really have too many languages anyway.*

I'm watching Deutschland 83, and it's really good. It's also reminding me that I haven't done any real-language stuff in a while; if I was a little better at German, the show might almost be figure-out-able! It's super anyway.

I was reminded today about my 100minds task to raise â‚¬1k for Childline. I need to get my act together there. I have a few small plans, I just need to get them sorted.

I'll keep hacking away at this blog code anyway. Hopefully my **Markdown** support should be working now. 

Gute Nacht, und frohe Weihnachten!
